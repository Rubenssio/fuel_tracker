Legend: [ ] = todo, [v] = done

[v] 00 — Bootstrap: runnable web service that returns "success" at /
[v] 01 — Persistence: add database to docker-compose; auto-apply schema and seed baseline data on start
[ ] 02 — Authentication: sign up/in/out with secure session cookies and CSRF
[ ] 03 — Profile & Settings: units, currency, timezone; conversions are view-time only (storage stays metric)
[ ] 04 — Vehicles: add/edit/delete; one user sees only their own data
[ ] 05 — Fill-Ups: create/edit/delete; validation & integrity rules (monotonic odometer, no future dates)
[ ] 06 — History: list with sorting, pagination, and filters (date/brand/grade/station/vehicle)
[ ] 07 — Metrics: per-fill calculations and rolling/all-time aggregates; rounding rules
[ ] 08 — Statistics: overview widgets and charts; brand/grade comparison table; vehicle/period selectors
[ ] 09 — Legal & Account: Terms, Privacy, data export (CSV), account deletion
[ ] 10 — Reliability & Security: user-friendly errors, no stack traces; strict self-data isolation
[ ] 11 — Observability & Logging: correlation IDs and auth event logs
[ ] 12 — Final pass: clean clone -> docker compose up -> everything reachable and meets performance notes
