Legend: [ ] = todo, [v] = done

[v] 00 — Bootstrap: runnable web service that returns "success" at /
[v] 01 — Persistence: add database to docker-compose; auto-apply schema and seed baseline data on start
[v] 02 — Authentication: sign up/in/out with secure session cookies and CSRF
[v] 03 — Profile & Settings: units, currency, timezone; conversions are view-time only (storage stays metric)
[v] 04 — Vehicles: add/edit/delete; one user sees only their own data
[v] 05 — Fill-Ups: create/edit/delete; validation & integrity rules (monotonic odometer, no future dates)
[v] 06 — History: list with sorting, pagination, and filters (date/brand/grade/station/vehicle)
[v] 07 — Metrics: per-fill calculations and rolling/all-time aggregates; rounding rules
[v] 08 — Statistics: overview widgets and charts; brand/grade comparison table; vehicle/period selectors
[ ] 09 — Legal & Account: Terms, Privacy, data export (CSV), account deletion
[ ] 10 — Reliability & Security: user-friendly errors, no stack traces; strict self-data isolation
[ ] 11 — Observability & Logging: correlation IDs and auth event logs
[ ] 12 — Final pass: clean clone -> docker compose up -> everything reachable and meets performance notes

# UI polish track (run AFTER step 12)
[ ] UI-01 — Base layout & style system: consistent spacing, typography scale, button/link states, alert/message components
[ ] UI-02 — Forms UX: inline validation errors, required markers, helpful placeholders/help-text, success/flash messages
[ ] UI-03 — Lists & tables: consistent table layout, empty states, basic sorting affordances, clear action buttons
[ ] UI-04 — Navigation & headers: tidy page titles/breadcrumbs, highlight active section, mobile-friendly nav
[ ] UI-05 — Responsive behavior: small/medium/large breakpoints; ensure core flows usable on phones
[ ] UI-06 — Accessibility baseline: semantic landmarks, labels for inputs, focus order, keyboard use, color contrast checks
[ ] UI-07 — Visual consistency pass: normalize margins/paddings, iconography placeholders, consistent component variants
[ ] UI-08 — Final UI check: screenshots of key pages, quick perf sanity (image sizes, minimal blocking assets)
